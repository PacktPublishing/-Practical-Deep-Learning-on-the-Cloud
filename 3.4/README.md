# 3.4 Importing a Pretrained CNN Model

In this lesson,  we will create a deep learning application with a pre-trained TensorFlow model for image classification, to learn how to import and use the model.

Used libraries: Tensorflow, Keras

## Steps

1. Run `python3 testInception.py`
2. Check the resulting prediction
