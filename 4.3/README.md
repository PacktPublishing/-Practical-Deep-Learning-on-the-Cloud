# 4.3 Using a Pretrained CNN Model for the New Dataset

In this lesson, we will learn how to implement them using Keras framework and will showcase fine-tuning for the image classification task.

Used libraries: Tensorflow, Keras

## Steps

1. Run `python3 finetuneInceptionFlower.py`
2. Check output files and prediction results
